# Getting the right code for the code base
    1. Make sure you have JS and python installed. 
    
    2. For Python, pip install all the required packages. For the react app, make sure to run npm install after navigating to Wind-Model/my-app.

# Using the Wind Model
    1. Open a new terminal go to the root folder of the repo, which is "your local path"\ISS-SDA. 
    
    2. Go to Wind-Model/main.py and make your preferences. If you want to load past data, type in the file_name and set generate_new_data to False. To create new/updated data, you can type in whatever you want to file name to be (or you can overwrite an existing file). Make sure you figure out which location you want and set the variable appropriately. 

    3. Type into terminal "py Wind-Model/main.py" (or python Wind-Model/main.py).

    4. Next, navigate to the my-app file in Wind-Model. Get to this by running cd Wind-Model/my-app in terminal.

    5. Now you can run the React app. Run it by typing "npm start" into the terminal. In a second, the model should open.
